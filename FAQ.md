### Frequently Asked Questions

- Q: Is voting from exchanges possible?
- A: No. Make sure to have an OCEAN balance in a non-custodial wallet before voting opens on Dec 15. 

###

- Q: How does Ocean relate to other Ocean funding programs (Shipyard, Data Economy Challenge)?
- A: They are complementary: 
  - Shipyard offers grants curated by the core Ocean team.
  - OceanDAO offers grants curated by the broader community of OCEAN holders.
  - Data Economy Challenge (DEC) offers prizes curated by expert judges from the community.

###

- Q: Is Ocean a governance DAO? Can we use it to change parameter x?
- A: No. OceanDAO is exclusively a grants DAO which gives funding for community-proposed projects. That’s it.

###

- Q: Is this Ocean V4? If no, does that mean you didn’t complete your roadmap?
- A: The [roadmap](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2020-f3ae281806dc) laid out shipping OceanDAO as Ocean Goal 4 / V4. In shipping OceanDAO, we are fulfilling Goal 4 and the promise of the roadmap. However, we are now reserving the label “Ocean V4” for future changes to Ocean smart contract software.

###

- Q: Why not [quadratic funding](https://github.com/gitcoinco/quadratic-funding)? [Quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting)? [Conviction voting](https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475)? [Futarchy](https://twitter.com/gnosisPM/status/1330906217007509507)? …?
- A: These are all great ideas. Currently we constrain ourselves to using readily-available tooling with a minimum of experimentation needed. None of the ideas listed fit that criteria. However as DAO tooling improves, we hope to be able to try out new ideas.

###

- Q: Are there plans for a governance DAO?
- A: Not at the present. This is also because, for Ocean, PRs or forks are generally more appropriate anyway, see below. Let’s see how things evolve.
  - For changes to Ocean Market code, then make a PR, or fork and make your own version.
  - For changes to libraries like ocean.js, then make a PR, or fork and make your own version.
  - For changes to the datatokens contracts: there is virtually nothing to change since they’re so simple. Basically just ERC20.
  - For changes to the pool contracts, fork it, change it, and deploy as your own version. We *want* more types of pools in Ocean.
