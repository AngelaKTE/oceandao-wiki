## What's OceanDAO?

OceanDAO offers community grants curated by the broader community of OCEAN holders. It's key to growth and sustainability of the [Ocean Protocol](https://www.oceanprotocol.com) ecosystem. [(Details.)](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e)

OceanDAO is a great way to get involved, by doing a project or by voting in OCEAN to help steer the future of the ecosystem.

Funding is for projects of these types:
- Build / improve applications or integrations to Ocean
- Outreach / community (grants don't need to be technical in nature)
- Unleash data
- Build / improve core Ocean software

[Here](Proposal-Ideas) are proposal ideas.

## Grant - Details

### Grant Recipients:

- **Amount:** In each funding round, winning projects will receive the current specified grant amount (see above) of OCEAN from OceanDAO. 
- **Grantees:** Each funding round, the Ocean Protocol Foundation (OPF) will define how many projects will receive grants. Further, these grantees will be selected by the top number of highest voted on proposals (additionally, to receive a grant you must also receive greater than 1% of the vote).

Funds will be disbursed to the grantees within 24 hours after voting ends.

Funds for OceanDAO currently come from the OPF.

### Non-Grant Recipients:

If you were not selected for a grant in this Funding Round, we highly encourage you to continue to stay involved in the Ocean community. You are appreciated! There are future OceanDAO funding rounds on the first of every month starting in February 2021, and other opportunities to receive [funding](https://oceanprotocol.com/fund).


## Dicussion

### Town Halls

The OceanDAO Town Hall is a regular videochat gatherings among community members, open to all. It‚Äôs a great place to get to know the community. Here you can ask questions, share proposal feedback, and more.

The **[Town Hall page](OceanDAO-Town-Hall)** has more info, including dates.

### Discord
Join the [OceanDAO Discord](https://discord.gg/uvyQFWGBn8) for ongoing collaboration and discussion. 

## On OceanDAO Evolution

The best practices and technology around DAOs are still evolving. OceanDAO‚Äôs strategy is to ‚Äúbake slowly‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto ratchet up value-at-risk over time, to give space to learn and for technology to improve. Accordingly, the amount of funds per Funding Round may vary, and OPF reserves the right to make changes in general. The aim is: if OceanDAO creates positive value, then the funds allocated to OceanDAO will go up.
