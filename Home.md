## What's OceanDAO?

OceanDAO offers community grants curated by the broader community of OCEAN holders. It's key to growth and sustainability of the [Ocean Protocol](https://www.oceanprotocol.com) ecosystem. [(Details.)](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e)

OceanDAO is a great way to get involved, by doing a project or by voting in OCEAN to help steer the future of the ecosystem.

Funding is for projects of these types:
- Build / improve applications or integrations to Ocean
- Outreach / community (grants don't need to be technical in nature)
- Unleash data
- Build / improve core Ocean software

[Here](Proposal-Ideas) are proposal ideas.

Project criteria: (1) [ROI](On-ROI) towards growth (2) aligned with Ocean mission. Details on criteria are in the page for a given funding round.

## Highlights

OceanDAO Funding Rounds have these actions and dates:

See expanded information on [Future and Previous rounds](future-and-previous-rounds).

## Steps - Summary

Here are steps for a given funding round.

- **For Projects:** Submit your project proposal. Answer community questions. The community votes whether to fund your project.
- **For Community Curators:** Learn about project proposals. Then, vote. Any OCEAN holder can vote. Vote for the projects that you think will add the most value. The weight of your vote is based on your OCEAN holdings. 

### Steps for Projects - Details

1. Post a proposal following [this template](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Grant-Proposal-Template), to [Ocean Discourse](https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/56).
1. Answer questions in [OceanDAO Discord](https://discord.gg/uvyQFWGBn8) and [OceanDAO Town Halls](OceanDAO-Town-Hall).
1. Receive grant, if voted a winner.
1. Do the project. Doing well here helps future funding requests.

### Steps for Community Curators - Details

1. Review projects at [Ocean Discourse](https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/56).
1. Ask questions in [OceanDAO Discord](https://discord.gg/uvyQFWGBn8) and [OceanDAO Town Halls](OceanDAO-Town-Hall).
1. Vote on projects to choose winners in [Ocean Shapshot](https://vote.oceanprotocol.com/).

## Voting
Follow this [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Voting) on the voting process and rules!

## Grant - Details

### Grant Recipients:

Winners
Each funding round will define how many winners there will be. These will be the top defined number of highest voted on proposals (additionally, to receive a grant you must also receive greater than 1% of the vote).

Amount
In each funding round, winning projects will receive the current specified grant amount of $OCEAN from OceanDAO. 

Funds will be disbursed to the grantees within 24 hours after voting ends.

Funds for OceanDAO currently come from Ocean Protocol Foundation (OPF).

### Non-Grant Recipients:

If you were not selected for a grant in this Funding Round, we highly encourage you to continue to stay involved in the Ocean community. You are appreciated! There are future OceanDAO funding rounds on the first of every month starting in February 2021, and other opportunities to receive [funding](https://oceanprotocol.com/fund).




## OceanDAO Town Hall

OceanDAO Town Hall is a regular videochat gatherings among community members, open to all. It‚Äôs a great place to get to know the community. Here you can ask questions, share proposal feedback, and more.

The **[Town Hall page](OceanDAO-Town-Hall)** has more info, including dates.

## On OceanDAO Evolution

The best practices and technology around DAOs are still evolving. OceanDAO‚Äôs strategy is to ‚Äúbake slowly‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto ratchet up value-at-risk over time, to give space to learn and for technology to improve. Accordingly, the amount of funds per Funding Round may vary, and OPF reserves the right to make changes in general. The aim is: if OceanDAO creates positive value, then the funds allocated to OceanDAO will go up.

## What's This Wiki?

It has the links and up-to-date information you need, to participate as a project team member or as a community curator. Being a wiki enables rapid update cycles, changeable by everyone to improve it.

# Project Criteria
When proposing a project, these are the two criteria to keep in consideration: (1) ROI towards **growth** (2) aligned with Ocean **mission**. Projects that fail (2) will not be considered for voting. Once voting opens, only criterion (1) remains. Let‚Äôs elaborate!

**Criterion (1). On average, value added to the Ocean ecosystem must exceed the grant value spent.**
- That is, the average ‚Äúreturn on investment‚Äù (ROI) must be > 1.0. Value added by a project is hard to know in advance. Some will fail; others will succeed and bring 10x value. But this must hold true on average across projects. 
- Motivation: We want a ‚Äúsnowball effect‚Äù for ecosystem growth, where more funds granted leads to more funds available for grants in the future. This will happen with more network revenue or a rise in OCEAN.
- Details on how to estimate expected ROI are [here](On-ROI).

**Criterion (2). The project must help to promote the Ocean‚Äôs mission & values (or at least not work against them).**
- Mission & values. Ocean‚Äôs mission is to equalize the opportunity for people to access data. Ocean‚Äôs values, and further details, are [here](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/mission-values-for-ocean-protocol-aba998e95b8).

#  Minimum Proposal Requirements

Anyone can propose a project to OceanDAO. However, to be considered, you **must have at least 5,000 OCEAN** in the same Ethereum wallet as listed in your proposal by the time the proposal process ends (December 14th, 23:59 pm GMT). If selected for a grant, this will be the same wallet where you will receive your grant funding. This helps to filter towards people with a vested interest or ‚Äúskin in the game‚Äù in OCEAN - that is, Ocean community members. Ocean Protocol team members will verify.
