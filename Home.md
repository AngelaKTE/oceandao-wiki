## What's OceanDAO?

OceanDAO offers community grants curated by the broader community of OCEAN holders. It's key to growth and sustainability of the [Ocean Protocol](https://www.oceanprotocol.com) ecosystem. [(Details.)](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e)

OceanDAO is a great way to get involved, by doing a project or by voting in OCEAN to help steer the future of the ecosystem.

Funding is for projects of these types:
- Build / improve applications or integrations to Ocean
- Outreach / community / spread awareness (grants don't need to be technical in nature)
- Unleash data
- Build / improve core Ocean software
- Improvements to OceanDAO 

[Here](Proposal-Ideas) are proposal ideas. [Here](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/OceanDAO-Grant-Recipients) are DAO grant recipients (winners) to date.

## Grant - Details

### Grant Recipients:

- **Amount:** In each funding round, winning projects will receive from OceanDAO, up to the maximum of OCEAN Requested if there is enough funds available to be distributed.
- **Grantees:** Each funding round, Ocean Protocol Foundation (OPF) will define a Maximum OCEAN Requested amount. Further, these grantees will be selected by the top number of highest voted on proposals (additionally, to receive a grant you must also receive over 50% "Yes" votes). Funds are then distributed in order, until there is nothing remaining. Any remaining funds will be burned.

Funding is conducted [Via Request](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Request-Grant-Guidelines). If you're voted to receive a grant, submit an invoice to the OPF.

Funds for OceanDAO currently come from the OPF.

Learn more about the current OceanDAO grant recipients projects in the [List of OceanDAO Grant Recipients](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/OceanDAO-Grant-Recipients). 

### Non-Grant Recipients:

If you were not selected for a grant in this Funding Round, we highly encourage you to continue to stay involved in the Ocean community.  

You are appreciated!  

## On OceanDAO Evolution

The best practices and technology around DAOs are still evolving. OceanDAO‚Äôs strategy is to ‚Äúbake slowly‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto ratchet up value-at-risk over time, to give space to learn and for technology to improve. Accordingly, the amount of funds per Funding Round may vary, and OPF reserves the right to make changes in general. The aim is: if OceanDAO creates positive value, then the funds allocated to OceanDAO will go up.

You can [learn more about our Roadmap](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-roadmap-update-mid-2021-3ea6ba80795d) and gain insights into what's ahead for OceanDAO.
