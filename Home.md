## What's OceanDAO?

OceanDAO offers grants curated by the broader community of OCEAN holders. It's key to growth and sustainability of the Ocean ecosystem. [(Details.)](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e)

- **For Projects:** Propose your project on Ocean Port (forum). Answer questions in Ocean Discord (chat). The community votes whether to fund your project.
- **For Community Curators:** Learn about projects via Ocean Port or Ocean Discord. Then, vote on Ocean Snapshot. Any OCEAN holder can vote. Vote for the projects that you think will add the most value. The weight of your vote is based on your OCEAN holdings.

## On OceanDAO Evolution ** 

The best practices and technology around DAOs are still evolving. OceanDAO‚Äôs strategy is to ‚Äúbake slowly‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto ratchet up value-at-risk over time, to give space to learn and for technology to improve. Accordingly, the amount of funds per Funding Round may vary, and OPF reserves the right to make changes in general. The aim is: if OceanDAO creates positive value, then the funds allocated to OceanDAO will go up.
