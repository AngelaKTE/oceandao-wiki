## What's OceanDAO?

OceanDAO offers community grants curated by the broader community of OCEAN holders. It's key to growth and sustainability of the [Ocean Protocol](https://www.oceanprotocol.com) ecosystem as defined by the [Web3 Sustainability Loop](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e).

OceanDAO is a great way to get involved, by doing a project or by voting in OCEAN to help steer the future of the ecosystem.

Funding is for projects of these types:
- Build / improve applications or integrations to Ocean
- Outreach / community / spread awareness (grants don't need to be technical in nature)
- Unleash data
- Build / improve core Ocean software
- Improvements to OceanDAO 

[Here](Proposal-Ideas) are proposal ideas. [Here](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/OceanDAO-Grant-Recipients) are DAO grant recipients (winners) to date. 

## Discussion

## OceanDAO Round 10

OceanDAO Funding Rounds happen every month and deadline is now **THE FIRST TUESDAY OF EVERY MONTH**.  

| **Funding Round**                      | **Proposals & 500 OCEAN Due By**      | 2 Day Due Diligence Window |  **Voting Starts**     | **Voting Ends**           | **Max Funding Amount** | **Total Round Funding Available** | **Round Earmark** |
| --                             | --                        | --                        |  --                             | -- | -- | -- |  -- |
| [Round 10](https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-10/69)  | Oct 5, 2021 at 23:59 GMT  | Ends Oct 7, 2021 at 23:59 GMT  | Oct 7, 2021 at 23:59 GMT  | Oct 11, 2021 at 23:59 PM GMT| $50,000 USD | $530,000 USD | $100,000 For New Teams |

PLEASE NOTE: The amount requested is in USD, but the amount paid is in OCEAN token. The conversion rate is the market price on the given Round's Proposal Due By Deadline. This determines how many OCEAN will be awarded if a proposal is voted to receive a grant. This is done automatically and updated in our [Funding Rounds Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrvk1ENKwlG8vOBL).

### [R10 Update] Funding Levels
OceanDAO is on a path of growth and sustainability. It builds upon fundamental concepts of decentralization, and delivering the required components for participants to self-actualize. As projects complete their outcomes, and deliver towards their ROI, the DAO should provide support to continue scaling. As teams complete their proposals, they may access increased funding.

**[1 - New Project :fish:]**
- No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO.
- Funding Ceiling: $20k USD
- There are earmarked funds each round for this group.

**[2 - Existing Project :dolphin:]**
- You have completed 1-2 grants previously.
- Funding Ceiling: $20k USD

**[3 - Veteran Project :whale2:]**
- You have completed 3+ grants.
- Funding Ceiling: $50k USD

## Steps - Summary

Here are steps for a given funding round.

- **For Community Curators:** Learn about project proposals. Then, vote. Any OCEAN holder can vote. Vote for the projects that you think will add the most value. The weight of your vote is based on your OCEAN holdings. 

### Steps for Projects - Details

1. Post a proposal following [this template](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Grant-Proposal-Template), to [Ocean Discourse](https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/56).
1. Answer questions in [OceanDAO Discord](https://discord.gg/uvyQFWGBn8) and [OceanDAO Town Halls](OceanDAO-Town-Hall).

## Voting
Follow this [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Voting) on the voting process and rules!

## Grant - Details

### Grant Recipients:

- **Amount:** In each funding round, winning projects will receive from OceanDAO, up to the maximum of OCEAN Requested if there is enough funds available to be distributed.
- **Grantees:** Each funding round, Ocean Protocol Foundation (OPF) will define a Maximum OCEAN Requested amount. In Round 9 we are introducing a weight to ‚ÄúNo Votes‚Äù. This means that ‚ÄúNo Votes‚Äù will be used to calculate a ‚ÄúFinal Score‚Äù for each proposal. Projects that receive greater than 50% Yes Votes, will then have a ‚ÄúFinal Score‚Äù calculated by the formula: Final Score = Yes Votes - No votes. Grantees are determined by highest ‚ÄúFinal Score‚Äù. Funds are distributed in descending order, until there are no funds remaining. Any remaining funds will be burned.

Funding is conducted [Via Request](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Request-Grant-Guidelines). If you're voted to receive a grant, submit an invoice to the OPF.

Funds for OceanDAO currently come from the OPF.

Learn more about the current OceanDAO grant recipients projects in the [List of OceanDAO Grant Recipients](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/OceanDAO-Grant-Recipients). 

### Non-Grant Recipients:

If you were not selected for a grant in this Funding Round, we highly encourage you to continue to stay involved in the Ocean community.  

You are appreciated!  

## On OceanDAO Evolution

The best practices and technology around DAOs are still evolving. OceanDAO‚Äôs strategy is to ‚Äúbake slowly‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto ratchet up value-at-risk over time, to give space to learn and for technology to improve. Accordingly, the amount of funds per Funding Round may vary, and OPF reserves the right to make changes in general. The aim is: if OceanDAO creates positive value, then the funds allocated to OceanDAO will go up.

You can [learn more about our Roadmap](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-roadmap-update-q3-2021-to-eoy-2022-c73038699a6f) and gain insights into what's ahead for OceanDAO.

### Snapshot Integration
- Ocean-Marketplace voting strategy can be found [here](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies/tree/master/src/strategies/ocean-marketplace)
- To submit a new strategy into OceanDAO, submit a new PR and `test/scores.ts` that validates the latest OceanDAO strategy. [here](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/snapshot-strategies).
