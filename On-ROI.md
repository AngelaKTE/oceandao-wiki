## Introduction

ROI = Return On Investment.

"(Expected) ROI towards growth" is a key criterion in OceanDAO. Accordingly:
- If you're making a project proposal, you should describe how it helps ROI
- If you're voting, you should be evaluating in terms of expected ROI

Summary: 
- Projects that aim to increase "$ datatoken consuming volume" (denominated in OCEAN) will tend to be favored.

This page elaborates further.

## Why "Expected ROI"?

### Expected ROI = bang / buck * (% chance of success)
Where 
* *bang* = value added to the Ocean ecosystem 
* *buck* = grant value spent
* *% chance of success* = e.g. an estimate by the project proposer (if you're the proposer) or by the voter (if you're the voter)

**On average, value added to the Ocean ecosystem must exceed the grant value spent.** That is, the average “return on investment” (ROI) must be > 1.0. Value added by a project is hard to know in advance. Some will fail; others will succeed and bring 10x value. But this must hold true on average across projects.

Motivation: We want a “snowball effect” for ecosystem growth, where more funds granted leads to more funds available for grants in the future. This will happen with more network revenue or a rise in OCEAN.

Expected ROI can be lower for lower-risk projects, and needs to be higher for higher-risk projects. It has similarity to the traditional VC thought process.

From an ecosystem perspective, if a project gets funding from outside the ecosystem, then it counts towards the value-add number, not to the value-spent number. This incentivizes projects to seek external funding, such as matching investments or quadratic funding.

Value can only be added to an ecosystem if the core product being built (by core devs) has last-mile apps for users (by app devs), which users can discover and find useful (go-to-market work). It’s a chain going from core product → dapps → discovery & usage → actual value add.


## How to Measure "Expected ROI"

The equation is *Expected ROI = bang / buck * (% chance of success)*, where:
* *bang* = value added to the Ocean ecosystem 
* *buck* = grant value spent
* *% chance of success* 

So how do we arrive at these values? Two of these are easy.
 * *% chance of success* is, for now, simply an estimate by the project proposer (if you're the proposer) or by the voter (if you're the voter). It could potentially use futarchy at some point, but let's not get ahead of ourselves!
 * *buck* is the grant value spent. This is denominated in OCEAN.

Recall that *buck* is "value added to the Ocean ecosystem." This is trickier. **What's a good metric for buck?**
* A first proposal is "effect on the value of $OCEAN". Alas, $OCEAN is a function of both speculation-based and fundamentals-based factors.  Speculation-based factors are harder to pin down as metrics, yet have a significant impact on $OCEAN. This means it's harder to measure the effect of a project on $OCEAN.
* Better: we can focus on fundamentals-based factors on $OCEAN or demand for OCEAN, which have clearer metrics. Eventually these will dominate $OCEAN. And in the meantime we will focus on growing the  metrics.

Here are some of the most important fundamentals-based metrics. When we say "$" we mean denominated in OCEAN. For estimates of ROI above, any of these will be suitable for use for the "bang" section.
* **$ Datatoken Consuming Volume.** This is (datatoken price in OCEAN) * (# consumes of that datatoken), summed across all datatokens. It's the best direct measure of amount of value being created in Ocean Protocol. 
* **Network Revenue.** This is the total $ revenue to Ocean community taken as a % of trades or consumes in Ocean Market, etc. We can compute a fundamental valuation by simply multiplying Network Revenue by P/S (price-to-sales ratio) of e.g. 30x or 50x (ref Binance or Zoom P/S figures).   
* **Total Value Locked (TVL)**, aka Assets Under Management (AUM). This is total $ staked in datatoken pools, or more generally. Demand for staking OCEAN drives demand for OCEAN and therefore $OCEAN. 

Here are some other interesting metrics that might be used as secondary metrics. 
* $ Datatoken Trading Volume. This is the sum of all purchases to buy datatokens, whether for speculation or for consume.
* Percent Consume Volume = ($ datatoken consuming volume) / ($ datatoken trading volume). What % of volume was for consuming data, versus for speculation. Speculation is ok, it helps for healthy markets! But too much speculation without consume is an indicator that the asset is overpriced for would-be consumers. Reference: in 2019 ETH had $0.7B consume volume (gas fees) and about $7B * 365 = $2.5T "trading volume, for a ratio of 0.7/2500 = 1/3500. That's healty. A ratio < 1/10000 would be unhealthy.
* Total revenue to all Ocean marketplace runners
* Total # datatoken contracts
* APY for Ocean Market stakers (measure after-the-fact, vs “forcing” it)
* # WAUs in Ocean Market or all markets
* Retention %, aka churn

We also welcome proposals that help OceanDAO itself. Here are some metrics of interest:
* $ proposed in OceanDAO (per round); $ proposed; $ proposed / funded
* # teams building on Ocean
* average ROI from OceanDAO funding (ideal, But hard to measure.)


- Projects that aim to increase "total $ of data consumed" will tend to be favored.

 But we want to hang our hat on the most pragmatic things possible, where "value added" can actually take on a few definitions.

 * Does it drive speculative value?
 * Does it drive fundamental value?

* Could it impact OCEAN directly?
