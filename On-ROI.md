## Introduction

ROI = Return On Investment.

"(Expected) ROI towards growth" is a key criterion in OceanDAO. Accordingly:
- If you're making a project proposal, you should describe how it helps ROI
- If you're voting, you should be evaluating in terms of expected ROI

This page describes more about ROI, including ways to measure "value added" which is a particular challenge.

## Why "Expected ROI"?

### Expected ROI = bang / buck * (% chance of success)
Where 
* *bang* = value added to the Ocean ecosystem 
* *buck* = grant value spent
* *% chance of success* = e.g. an estimate by the project proposer (if you're the proposer) or by the voter (if you're the voter)

**On average, value added to the Ocean ecosystem must exceed the grant value spent.** That is, the average “return on investment” (ROI) must be > 1.0. Value added by a project is hard to know in advance. Some will fail; others will succeed and bring 10x value. But this must hold true on average across projects.

Motivation: We want a “snowball effect” for ecosystem growth, where more funds granted leads to more funds available for grants in the future. This will happen with more network revenue or a rise in OCEAN.

Expected ROI can be lower for lower-risk projects, and needs to be higher for higher-risk projects. It has similarity to the traditional VC thought process.

From an ecosystem perspective, if a project gets funding from outside the ecosystem, then it counts towards the value-add number, not to the value-spent number. This incentivizes projects to seek external funding, such as matching investments or quadratic funding.

Value can only be added to an ecosystem if the core product being built (by core devs) has last-mile apps for users (by app devs), which users can discover and find useful (go-to-market work). It’s a chain going from core product → dapps → discovery & usage → actual value add.


## How to Measure "Expected ROI"

The equation is *Expected ROI = bang / buck * (% chance of success)*, where:
* *bang* = value added to the Ocean ecosystem 
* *buck* = grant value spent
* *% chance of success* 

So how do we arrive at these values? Two of these are easy.
 * *% chance of success* is, for now, simply an estimate by the project proposer (if you're the proposer) or by the voter (if you're the voter). It could potentially use futarchy at some point, but let's not get ahead of ourselves!
 * *buck* is the grant value spent. This is denominated in OCEAN.

What's not as easy to measure is *buck*, i.e. the value added to the Ocean ecosystem. But we want to hang our hat on the most pragmatic things possible, where "value added" can actually take on a few definitions.
