"ROI towards growth" is key criterion in OceanDAO. Accordingly:
- If you're making a project proposal, you should describe how it helps ROI
- If you're voting, you should be evaluating in terms of ROI

This page describes more about ROI.

**On average, value added to the Ocean ecosystem must exceed the grant value spent.**
- That is, the average “return on investment” (ROI) must be > 1.0. Value added by a project is hard to know in advance. Some will fail; others will succeed and bring 10x value. But this must hold true on average across projects.
- Motivation: We want a “snowball effect” for ecosystem growth, where more funds granted leads to more funds available for grants in the future. This will happen with more network revenue or a rise in OCEAN.
