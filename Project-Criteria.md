## Summary

Project criteria: (1) [ROI](On-Roi) towards growth, (2) aligned with Ocean mission, (3) meet a minimum proposal requirement.

## Details

When proposing a project, these are the three criteria to keep in consideration: (1) ROI towards **growth** (2) aligned with Ocean **mission**. Projects that fail (2) will not be considered for voting. Once voting opens, only criterion (1) remains. Additionally, your proposal must (3) meet a minimum proposal requirement. Let’s elaborate!

**Criterion (1). On average, value added to the Ocean ecosystem must exceed the grant value spent.**
- That is, the average “return on investment” (ROI) must be > 1.0. Value added by a project is hard to know in advance. Some will fail; others will succeed and bring 10x value. But this must hold true on average across projects. 
- Motivation: We want a “snowball effect” for ecosystem growth, where more funds granted leads to more funds available for grants in the future. This will happen with more network revenue or a rise in OCEAN.

**Criterion (2). The project must help to promote the Ocean’s mission & values (or at least not work against them).**
- Mission & values. Ocean’s mission is to equalize the opportunity for people to access data. Ocean’s values, and further details, are [here](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/mission-values-for-ocean-protocol-aba998e95b8).

**Criterion (3). Minimum Proposal Requirement.**
- Anyone can propose a project to OceanDAO. However, to be considered, you **must have at least 2,000 OCEAN** in the same Ethereum wallet as listed in your proposal by the time the proposal process ends (first day of month at 23:59 GMT). If selected for a grant, this will be the same wallet where you will receive your grant funding. This helps to filter towards people with a vested interest or “skin in the game” in OCEAN - that is, Ocean community members. Ocean Protocol team members will verify.
