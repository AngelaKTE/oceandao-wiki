## Summary

Project criteria: 
1. Return on Investment [(ROI)](On-Roi) towards growth
1. Aligned with Ocean mission
1. Meet a minimum proposal requirement.
1. One Project/One proposal

## Details of Criteria

In OceanDAO, governance is about directing the flow of resources towards the teams and projects that offer the best chance for growth. OCEAN holders are incentivized to do work to learn more about each team and project proposal, and then use OceanDAO to vote for the most promising teams/projects.

When proposing a project, these are the three criteria to keep in consideration: (1) ROI towards **growth** (2) aligned with Ocean **mission**. Projects that fail (2) will not be considered for voting. Once voting opens, only criterion (1) remains. Additionally, your proposal must (3) meet a minimum proposal requirement and make sure to understand that (4) One Project / One proposal. Let’s elaborate!

**Criterion (1). On average, value added to the Ocean ecosystem must exceed the grant value spent.**
- That is, the average “return on investment” (ROI) must be > 1.0. Value added by a project is hard to know in advance. Some will fail; others will succeed and bring 10x value. But this must hold true on average across projects. 
- Motivation: We want a “snowball effect” for ecosystem growth, where more funds granted leads to more funds available for grants in the future. This will happen with more network revenue or a rise in OCEAN.

**Criterion (2). The project must help to promote the Ocean’s mission & values (or at least not work against them).**
- Mission & values. Ocean’s mission is to equalize the opportunity for people to access data. Ocean’s values, and further details, are [here](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/mission-values-for-ocean-protocol-aba998e95b8).
- Any project that pays or rewards for voting in any way **will disqualify the project** from the round.
- Any project that infringes copyright, or licensing agreements **may be blacklisted**.

**Criterion (3). Minimum Proposal Requirement.**
- Anyone can propose a project to OceanDAO. However, to be considered, you **must have at least 500 OCEAN** in the same Ethereum wallet as listed in your proposal by the time the proposal process ends. If selected for a grant, this will be the same wallet where you will receive your grant funding. This helps to filter towards people with a vested interest or “skin in the game” in OCEAN - that is, Ocean community members. Ocean Protocol team members will verify.
- You need to have 500 OCEAN in specifically an ETH Wallet address (OCEAN on other blockchains will not be accepted for the 500 minimum parameter; eg BSC or Polygon are ineligible).

**Criterion (4). One Project/One proposal**

Coordination is important in every DAO. To increase transparency and reduce confusion, we recommend every project reports their “Core Team” and their “Advisors”.

- In a given round an individual can only be on one "Core Team" but could be "Advisor" on any number of teams.
- If any person is in >1 team as a “Core Team” member, and not an "Advisor", then every proposal that person is in will be disqualified.
- If a “Core Team” member has previously received a grant, any project in the future with that participant will not be eligible for a “New Team” earmark.

The Grant Proposal Template is updated to make this easy for teams to communicate their project structure.

At the end of the day what matters is not how many projects you are on BUT shipping the actual project deliverables. And if you’re unable to ship your deliverables, the community has the ability to ask questions and vote how they choose.


## On ROI

The criteria of ROI -- Return on Investment -- will take particular care. The [ROI page](On-Roi) has detailed info.
