## Summary

Project criteria: 
1. Return on Investment [(ROI)](On-Roi) towards growth
1. Aligned with Ocean mission
1. Meet a minimum proposal requirement.

## Details of Criteria

In OceanDAO, governance is about directing the flow of resources towards the teams and projects that offer the best chance for growth. OCEAN holders are incentivized to do work to learn more about each team and project proposal, and then use OceanDAO to vote for the most promising teams/projects.

When proposing a project, these are the three criteria to keep in consideration: (1) ROI towards **growth** (2) aligned with Ocean **mission**. Projects that fail (2) will not be considered for voting. Once voting opens, only criterion (1) remains. Additionally, your proposal must (3) meet a minimum proposal requirement. Let’s elaborate!

**Criterion (1). On average, value added to the Ocean ecosystem must exceed the grant value spent.**
- That is, the average “return on investment” (ROI) must be > 1.0. Value added by a project is hard to know in advance. Some will fail; others will succeed and bring 10x value. But this must hold true on average across projects. 
- Motivation: We want a “snowball effect” for ecosystem growth, where more funds granted leads to more funds available for grants in the future. This will happen with more network revenue or a rise in OCEAN.

**Criterion (2). The project must help to promote the Ocean’s mission & values (or at least not work against them).**
- Mission & values. Ocean’s mission is to equalize the opportunity for people to access data. Ocean’s values, and further details, are [here](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/mission-values-for-ocean-protocol-aba998e95b8).


*Any project that pays or rewards for voting in anyway will disqualify the project from the round.

**Criterion (3). Minimum Proposal Requirement.**
- Anyone can propose a project to OceanDAO. However, to be considered, you **must have at least 500 OCEAN** in the same Ethereum wallet as listed in your proposal by the time the proposal process ends (first day of month at 23:59 GMT). If selected for a grant, this will be the same wallet where you will receive your grant funding. This helps to filter towards people with a vested interest or “skin in the game” in OCEAN - that is, Ocean community members. Ocean Protocol team members will verify.

## On ROI

The criteria of ROI -- Return on Investment -- will take particular care. The [ROI page](On-Roi) has detailed info.
