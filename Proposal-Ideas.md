## Introduction

Want to help but still looking for ideas on what to propose? Here's some inspiration:
 * Browse through the rest of this page, and
 * See the ‚ÄúRequest for Proposal‚Äù ideas [in OceanDAO Forum](https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/oceandao-request-for-proposal/268). (And if you *do* have ideas then post them there:)

###

**Types of Projects.** Recall that funding is for projects of these four types:
1. Build / improve applications or integrations to Ocean
1. Outreach / community (grants don't need to be technical in nature)
1. Unleash data
1. Build / improve core Ocean software

For each of these funding types, there's a section below with further resources.

But before we get there, first we give a shortlist of things we'd particularly like to see. (This will evolve!)

## Shortlist 
 
- Networking / "hitting the phones" to increase data supply and data consumption in Ocean Market
- Creating data that you think will be popular / consumed on Ocean Market.
- Integrate streaming data services. Of special interest: Streamr, WebSockets, and GraphQL Subscriptions
- Integrate as data services: Filecoin, Chainlink, OpenMined, CoinMarketCap, Messari, Numerai, Energy Web Foundation, phone data
- Your own data market (fork of Ocean Market). Of special interest: novel curation, novel pricing, specific verticals
- Datatoken analytics app - like Defipulse for datatokens
- Datatoken wallets - such as Pillar wallet with datatoken features
- Data DAOs - such as DAOstack with datatoken features
- Data bounty app - bounties/prizes for supplying target data
- DeFi apps that use data as a financial asset

For a given item above, you'll find more details later in this page, just search for it.

## 1. Build / improve applications or integrations to Ocean

We're interested in seeing riffs of data markets, new apps using Ocean, and integrations of Ocean into existing crypto & AI apps.

### App: Your own data market

The fastest way is to fork [Ocean Market code](https://www.github.com/oceanprotocol/market). Main resources:
- [Marketplaces" page at oceanprotocol.com](https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/marketplaces)
- [Ocean Market introductory blog post](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3) 

### Other specific apps

- Datatoken analytics app - like Defipulse for datatokens. Include summary statistics like total AUM, total sales, total consumes.
- Data bounty app - where people post ‚Äúdata bounties‚Äù or ‚Äúprizes‚Äù that can be won by others who supply the data first, or supply the best data.
- Datatoken wallets. E.g. Pillar wallet with datatoken features 
- Data DAOs. E.g. DAOstack with datatoken features. Inspiration: [Data DAOs blog/video](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/radical-markets-and-the-data-economy-4847c272f5)
- DeFi apps that use data as a financial asset. Our vision is for all [top DeFi protocols / apps](https://www.defipulse.com) to include datatokens as first-class citizens.

### Privacy-preserving apps

There are many opportunities for apps and integrations that preserve privacy, including:
- Use [Ocean Compute-to-Data](https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/compute-to-data) data service for new data science flows, or to help unlock private data
- Integration with [Secret Network](https://scrt.network) [for non-custodial url handling](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-and-secret-collaborating-on-access-control-and-private-compute-for-datatokens-1427acd1fcbe).

### Data science apps

Here are resources with ideas for apps and integrations to help data scientists:

## 2. Outreach / community

Remember, grants can go beyond technical in nature! :) Here are ideas related to outreach and community.

### Administrative / Management
- Social media admin. For example, help to man the official Ocean Telegram or Discord
- Create your own Ocean Meetup group, Telegram channel or Discord server for a specific niche (e.g. language, region, topic matter), and foster a community around it

### Outreach collateral
- Writing blogs about Ocean and the Data Economy, perhaps around a target niche
- Creating tutorials & how-to guides about Ocean
- Running a podcast
- Going crazy with creating Ocean memes or other marketing assets üßúüßú‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Scalable Workshops
- Solo & Group video | github | web workshops that can scale in reach, and onboard various communities. I.E. Meetups. Kaggle Groups.
- Simple apps, and workshops that highlight Web3 Decentralized Data-Economy UX.
- Biz Dev - Data Economy Workshops: How to make your company's data the top performing asset.
- Engineering - Ocean App Workshop: How to generate data, and monetize it. N-Buy random 1 participant.
- Engineering - Ocean Developer Workshop: How to manage your own Metadata.

## 3. Unleash data

There are two main ways help unleash data:
- Business / networking based -- not technical
- Integrations to data services -- technical

Let's elaborate on each.

### Business / networking approaches
- Networking / "hitting the phones" to increase data *supply* into Ocean Market. Go find other orgs, from startups to enterprises, that have tons of data, and work with them to publish their data on Ocean Market. To align incentives, have a contract with them to get a % of their sales. Alternatively, contract with them to publish on their behalf (congrats, you're now a data broker:). 
- Networking / "hitting the phones" to increase data *consumption* from Ocean Market. Go find other orgs, from startups to enterprises, that are used to spending $ to consume data. Connect them with data for sale on Ocean Market (most straightforward) or find data suppliers that meet their needs and get the suppliers to publish (more work but very rewarding:). To align incentives, have a contract with them to get a % of their purchases.
- Creating data that you think will be popular / consumed on Ocean Market. For example, find open data, add value to it, and sell it yourself. Or find open data, find others who can add value, and help connect the dots. See details in ["On Selling Data"](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-selling-data-in-ocean-market-9afcfa1e6e43) blog post.

### Integrations with data services

The idea is that you can unleash more data via integrations into other data services. The integration should make it easy to buy & sell access to a specific data asset as an Ocean datatoken. One good way to implement ideas below is to fork [Ocean Provider code](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/provider), make the change, and tune things for good UX. 

Here are some integrations that unlock data, which we're particularly interested in.
- [Streamr Network](https://streamr.network). Ideal result: ability to access a Streamr data stream, wrapped as an Ocean datatoken. Also nice: low friction to convert Streamr data stream to a static dataset (eg using [Streamr JS client](https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-client-javascript)) and wrap as an Ocean datatoken
- [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API). For example, build on the ["Osmosis" prototype](https://devpost.com/software/osmosis-streaming-driver) integration into Ocean.
- [GraphQL subscriptions](https://www.programmableweb.com/news/how-to-build-streaming-api-using-graphql-subscriptions/how-to/2019/12/09).
- Filecoin - as a data service or otherwise. There are likely many variations on this.
- Chainlink - ""
- [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/) integrated as a data service or otherwise.
- CoinMarketCap API, Messari API, other financial data providers
- Numerai Signals
- Energy Web Foundation - ideally to solve a real-world challenge in the energy sector. For example: optimizing dispatch of energy assets to provide grid flexibility, identifying an innovative new application of data from energy device
- phone data as a data service - a phone app that gets permissions to access phone data, and helps the consumer to monetize it.



## 4. Build / improve core Ocean software

The best way to help improve Ocean core software is to start engaging with other core contributors on specific issues listed on [Ocean Protocol Github](https://github.com/oceanprotocol). With time, you will be positioned to take bigger leaps.

Your project proposal could be to simply "help address Github issues in components x & y" and we'd be very happy with if you did it effectively:). Here are GitHub issues of our core repos: [Ocean Market](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market/issues), [Provider](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/provider/issues), [ocean.js](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js/issues), [React hooks](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/react/issues), [ocean.py](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/issues) 


## 5. Improvements to OceanDAO

If you are an avid OceanDAO enthusiast and see ways that the DAO itself can make improvements, submit a proposal which could increase its efficiency. The core DAO components include: discussion, proposal submission, feedback, voting, DAO treasury.
