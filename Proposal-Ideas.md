## Introduction

Looking for inspiration, insights and ideas for what to propose? Browse through some of the following resources for ideas.

Recall that funding is for projects of these four types:
1. Build / improve applications or integrations to Ocean
1. Outreach / community (grants don't need to be technical in nature)
1. Unleash data
1. Build / improve core Ocean software

For each of these funding types, there's a section below with further resources.

## 1. Build / improve applications or integrations to Ocean

Create an innovative application using Ocean Protocol. Use Ocean Protocol libraries to build your own app for secure, privacy-preserving data exchange.

## 2. Outreach / community

Remember, grants don't need to be technical in nature! :) Here are ideas related to outreach and community.

**Administrative / Management**
- Social media admin. For example, help to man the official Ocean Telegram or Discord
- Create an Ocean Meetup groups, Telegram or Discord for a specific language, region or topic matter, and foster a community around it

**Outreach collateral**
- Writing blogs about Ocean and the Data Economy, perhaps around a target niche
- Creating tutorials & how-to guides about Ocean
- Running a podcast
- Going crazy with creating Ocean memes or other marketing assets üßúüßú‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## 3. Unleash data

There are two main ways help unleash data:
* Business / networking based -- not technical
* Integrations to data services -- technical

Let's elaborate on each.

**Business / networking approaches**
* Networking / "hitting the phones" to increase data *supply* into Ocean Market. Go find other orgs, from startups to enterprises, that have tons of data, and work with them to publish their data on Ocean Market. To align incentives, have a contract with them to get a % of their sales. Alternatively, contract with them to publish on their behalf (congrats, you're now a data broker:). 
* Networking / "hitting the phones" to increase data *consumption* from Ocean Market. Go find other orgs, from startups to enterprises, that are used to spending $ to consume data. Connect them with data for sale on Ocean Market (most straightforward) or find data suppliers that meet their needs and get the suppliers to publish (more work but very rewarding:). To align incentives, have a contract with them to get a % of their purchases.
* Find open data, add value to it, and sell it yourself! Or find open data, find others who can add value, and help connect the dots. See details in ["On Selling Data"](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-selling-data-in-ocean-market-9afcfa1e6e43) blog post, section "Selling Value-Added Open Data".

**Integrations with data services**

The idea is that you can unleash more data via integrations into more data services. The integration should make it easy to buy & sell access to a specific data asset as an Ocean datatoken. 

The integration may be implemented as a fork of github.com/oceanprotocol/provider, and tuned for UX.


## 4. Build / improve core Ocean software

**Ocean GitHub**
