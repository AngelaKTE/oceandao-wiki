## Introduction

Looking for inspiration, insights and ideas for what to propose? Browse through some of the following resources for ideas.

Recall that funding is for projects of these four types:
* Build / improve applications or integrations to Ocean
* Outreach / community (grants don't need to be technical in nature)
* Unleash data
* Build / improve core Ocean software

For each of these funding types, there's a section below with further resources.

## Build / improve applications or integrations to Ocean

Create an innovative application using Ocean Protocol. Use Ocean Protocol libraries to build your own app for secure, privacy-preserving data exchange.

**Marketplace Applications**
- ["Marketplaces" page](https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/marketplaces) at oceanprotocol.com - Data Marketplaces with Blockchain Superpowers
- Ocean Market: An Open-Source Community Marketplace for Data](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3) Featuring Ocean Staking, Automated Market Makers and Initial Data Offerings

**Possible Verticals for Marketplaces or Other Apps**

- [Health](http://trent.st/content/McConaghy%20-%20AI%20SG%20-%20Ocean%20and%20Health.pdf) Benefits of Ocean's compute-to-data for healthcare research and patient services

## Outreach / community

Remember, grants don't need to be technical in nature! :) Here are ideas related to outreach and community.

**Administrative / Management**
- Social media admin. For example, help to man the official Ocean Telegram or Discord
- Create an Ocean Meetup groups, Telegram or Discord for a specific language, region or topic matter, and foster a community around it

**Outreach collateral**
- Writing blogs about Ocean and the Data Economy, perhaps around a target niche
- Creating tutorials & how-to guides about Ocean
- Running a podcast
- Going crazy with creating Ocean memes or other marketing assets üßúüßú‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Unleash data

The integration should make it easy to buy & sell access to a specific data asset as an Ocean datatoken. Unleash more data via integrations into more data services.

The integration may be implemented as a fork of github.com/oceanprotocol/provider, and tuned for UX.
