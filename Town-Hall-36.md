## Notes


OceanDAO Design/Governance Call:
- We are organizing a OceanDAO call on the 24th of August (same time as Town Hall) to talk about ongoing work on governance, and design of OceanDAO.
- We're looking forward to providing more insights and mental models surrounding the overall funding and growth ecosystem.
- We are very excited to increase transparency and communication with everyone in the DAO, in order to continue improving towards the greater outcomes of ocean protocol.
- We'll be sharing the link here and invite everyone to join.

Voting Improvements:
- We're doing test as a larger initiative to increase voter access, and we are working on implementing: uniswap v2 + sushiswap + bancor strategies.
- If you see something funny on https://vote.oceanprotocol.com/#/ we are likely doing some tests.
- You can find out how to contribute below:
