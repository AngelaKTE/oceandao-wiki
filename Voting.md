# How To Vote

![](https://github.com/dcrapis/oceandao-wiki-files/blob/main/voting-oceandao.png)

Once voting begins you will see the active proposals on the ballot. You can use your OCEAN tokens to vote Yes or No for each proposal.

Voting:
- Connect your Web3 wallet containing your OCEAN tokens.
- Select the fraction of OCEAN tokens you want to allocate to each preference. 
	- In the example, we are voting with 10% of our OCEAN for `Acute Apple - Yes`, 20% for `Oblong Orange - Yes` and 70% for `Artisanal Banana - No`.
	- If we have 1,000 OCEAN in our wallet this will allocate 100 OCEAN, 200 OCEAN, and 700 OCEAN respectively.
- Click `Vote` and Sign with your wallet (Note: there are no gas fees, no ETH required, and OCEAN tokens never leave your wallet).

Results:
- The current results tab will adjust accordingly as votes are counted.
- XXX The proposals with the highest votes will receive grants based on how many grants will be distributed in the current round. 

Note: the vote counts the amount of OCEAN in your wallet and OCEAN staked on Ocean Market. No OCEAN will be taken from your wallet. Again: it is a gasless transaction and there is no fee.

# Voting Parameters:

- At proposal deadline (the first day of every month at 23:59 pm GMT), Proposals that meet the “Project Criteria” will be migrated to the OceanDAO Voting Page.

- Vote with your OCEAN Tokens in your wallet or staked on Ocean Market. 1 OCEAN = 1 vote.

- In order for your vote to count, you must have the OCEAN already in the non-custodial wallet you plan on voting with before the vote opens (the first day of every month at 23:59 pm GMT) or staked on the Ocean Marketplace. This is so your existing OCEAN balance can be counted. Voting from exchanges is not supported.

- Your wallet address can only vote on one proposal. If you would like to vote on more than one proposal, you will need to fund your multiple wallet addresses with the respective amount of OCEAN before the voting opens.

- You can only vote with the OCEAN tokens in your wallet or staked on Ocean Market. You will be unable to vote with OCEAN that is deposited as liquidity in Bancor, Uniswap, or otherwise. It is your choice if you would like to remove liquidity, vote, and re-add the liquidity back later from AMMs. Risks come with removing liquidity (impermanent loss etc). This is up to you to manage.

- Voting with staked OCEAN in Ocean Market: your initial voting power in Snapshot will reflect how many OCEAN as ERC20 are in your wallet. However, once you cast your vote and if staking, your number of OCEAN on the marketplace will then be included.
