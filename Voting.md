## How To Vote:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/0*xy_BvLdqNnvVvdYv)

- Once voting begins you will see the active proposals on the ballot.
- Connect your Web3 wallet containing your OCEAN tokens.
- Select the proposal you wish to vote for.
- Click “Vote” and sign with your wallet.
- There are no gas fees, no ETH required, and OCEAN tokens never leave your wallet
- Vote percentages will adjust accordingly as votes are counted.
- The proposals with the highest votes will receive grants based on how many grants will be distributed in the current round. 

Note: the vote simply just counts the amount of OCEAN in your wallet. No OCEAN will be taken from your wallet. It is a gasless transaction; there is no fee.

## Voting Parameters:

- At proposal deadline (the first day of every month at 23:59 pm GMT), Proposals that meet the “Project Criteria” will be migrated to the OceanDAO Voting Page.

- Vote with your OCEAN Tokens. 1 OCEAN = 1 vote.

- In order for your vote to count, you must have the OCEAN already in the non-custodial wallet you plan on voting with before the vote opens (the first day of every month at 23:59 pm GMT). This is so your existing OCEAN balance can be counted. Voting from exchanges is not supported.

- Your wallet address can only vote on one proposal. If you would like to vote on more than one proposal, you will need to fund your multiple wallet addresses with the respective amount of OCEAN before the voting opens.

- You can only vote with the OCEAN tokens in your wallet. You will be unable to vote with OCEAN that is deposited as liquidity in Ocean Market, Bancor, or otherwise. It is your choice if you would like to remove liquidity, vote, and re-add the liquidity back later. Risks come with removing liquidity (impermanent loss etc). This is up to you to manage. In the future, we aim to support voting without needing to remove liquidity (e.g. vote with BPTs).
