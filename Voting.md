Voting: Details

Voting will take place on: vote.oceanprotocol.com

Implementation:

- At proposal deadline (December 14th at 23:59 pm GMT), Proposals that meet the “Minimum Proposal Requirements” and “Project Criteria” will be migrated to the OceanDAO Voting Page.

- Vote with your OCEAN Tokens. 1 OCEAN = 1 vote.

- In order for your vote to count, you must have the OCEAN already in the non-custodial wallet you plan on voting with before the vote opens (December 15th at 12:00 pm GMT). This is so your existing OCEAN balance can be counted. Voting from exchanges is not supported.

- Your wallet address can only vote on one proposal. If you would like to vote on more than one proposal, you will need to fund your multiple wallet addresses with the respective amount of OCEAN before the voting opens.

- You can only vote with the OCEAN tokens in your wallet. You will be unable to vote with OCEAN that is deposited as liquidity in Ocean Market, Bancor, or otherwise. It is your choice if you would like to remove liquidity, vote, and re-add the liquidity back later. Risks come with removing liquidity (impermanent loss etc). This is up to you to manage. In the future, we aim to support voting without needing to remove liquidity (e.g. vote with BPTs).
